"""
NDA requires fMRI tasks have an Experiment ID.
The simplest way to deal with this is
populating the "ExperimentID" key in a _bold.json sidecar.

But at the time of upload,
it many be desirable to leave underlying dataset unmodified.
This provides an alternative:
match input filename against a set of patterns to set the ExperimentID.

Patterns are imported from a tab separated text file.
An EID can have many patterns (why? maybe for extra modalities?)
